Today we laughed a whole lot

116
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,100
We had a great time

117
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:24,500
At times with my friends acting like fools being noisy

118
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,560
Fluttering our eyes met.

119
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,240
It's a coincidence right?

120
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,740
I wouldn't call this my first love

121
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,910
It's not my character.

122
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:42,960
Say will we be able to meet again tomorrow?

123
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,060
As my eyelids close

124
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,180
I see you sparkling all over the place

125
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:52,500
Today was fun too wasn't it?

126
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,430
I'm in love~

127
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,000
So happy so happy

128

It is my pleasure to meet you my new-found love.

129
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:11,230
Surely we'll meet again tomorrow~

130
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,410
Have a good night

131
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:18,450
We'll meet immediately in our dreams

What's wrong Yukko?

202
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,730
I can't summon the motivation to do anything. {Motivation for doing stuff won't come out.}{I don't feel like doing anything.}

00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:10,200
What are you talking about?

204
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,440
We're high school students you know.

205
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:13,740
It's the start of a new term.

206
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,580
{You'll be motivated to do }Motivation is something that comes out naturally once you start doing it.

The motivation to do something before actually doing it won't come out. {won't be there before you start doing it.}

How do I get motivated to do
something before I actually start doing it{to do it}?

209

If that happens

242
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,700
{you just need to say }saying "I'm a third year student!" should be enough don't you think?

247
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,370
It might suddenly start pouring down you know!

248
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,380
A shower or a hailstorm...

249
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,780

Mai-chan you should say selamat pagi there!

284
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,870
What language is that?

285
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,410
H-Homeroom will begin.

286
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,190
Um when I came to school this morning this was in the shoe rack...

287
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,180
Did anyone put this in there?

288
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,810
U-Um... If there is anyone who knows about it please tell me okay?

289
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:02,660
Mio-chan I wonder who did that?

290
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,280
Maybe it's a prank?

291
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,650
It might be something unexpected
like a student who likes the teacher...

292
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,900
I don't think they would leave a Maitreya statue though.

293
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,530
But well it's not like I don't understand
people who have unachievable aspirations.

294
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,950
Yeah it's that right?

295
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,580
Like the way you feel about Sasahara-senpai.

296
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,710
Y-You idiot!

297
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,130

00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,480
I have to get home!

299
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,880
I'm sure the professor is worried

300
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,490
and leaving her with the charcoal stove is dangerous. {iken: why can't Shichirin be translated? "charcoal stove"}

301
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,630
Eh?

302
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,970
I can't get off!

303
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:06,620
Eh?

304
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,670
My chopsticks are gone!

305
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,920
One of my shoes is gone as well!

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,750
What should I do?!

307
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,470
My hand's gone!

308
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,110
Now it'll be exposed that I am a robot!

309
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,500
Here it goes.

310
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,360
Thank you for the food.

311
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,810
If you don't finish up quick the bell for fifth period will ring.

312
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:56,610
Huh?

313
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,220
You didn't like sausages?

314
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:05,660
Saving the most delicious food for last in a lunch box is fundamental.

315
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:09,690
Then I can finish by saying: "It's delicious".

316
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,240
Well then here goes... I'm going to eat it!

317
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,110
It came out!

318
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,440
Not yet!

319
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,460
It's over!

320
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,750
Not just yet!

321
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,090
One...

322
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,250
...two...

323
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,760
...three.

324
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,480
Safe!

325
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,980
You're out!

326
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,830
No way Mio-chan!

327
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,930
It's the three-second rule the three-second rule.

328
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:37,240
No you were already out way before that!

329
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,850
It's delicious!

330
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,430
Yukko really is an idiot.

331
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,270
First comes rock next comes paper rockscispaper doesn't count

332
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,430
rock paper scissors!

333
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:16,690
Yes!

334
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,450
Good morning everyone.

335
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:30,620
Spring has come and a new year has started

336
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,750
but the cold days are still continuing.

337
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,760
In my case I have it twice as cold as everyone else.

338
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,840
Anyway make sure you don't catch a cold...

339
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,640
This is a promise with your principal okay?

340
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:53,600
If you don't listen then I'll be...

341
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,730
...transferred to a different school on principle!

342
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,450
Mio-chan Mio-chan.

343
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:06,080
What?

344
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,080
He'll get mad if you talk.

345
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:13,690
Say doesn't the principal notice that his jokes are way too old?

346
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:19,220
He must know best of all that his jokes aren't received very well.

347
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,420
I wonder about that...

348
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,630
Could it be that he knows his jokes aren't received well

349
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,720
and is putting on a show of even more
effort to the young people nowadays?!

350
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,600
If that's true then this principal...

351
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,700
...is pretty skilful!

352
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:40,860
Mai-chan?!

353
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,470
Mai-chan is...?!

354
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,830
Could it be because of that old man gag?

355
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,290
Above that this is the first time I've ever seen her laughing so hard!

356
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,030
All right!

357
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,000
This should do it!

358
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,540
Mai-chan!

359
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,920
Why is it?

360
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,380
If I said it here now I feel like I'll lose everything.

361
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,800
Yukko.

362
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,780
Sorry.

363
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,640
Never mind actually.

364
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,100
I guess until she notices...

365
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,020
...I won't grab it.

366
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:38,560
Well then next is a talk about student guidance from Sakurai-sensei.

367
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,000
Sakurai-sensei please.

368
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,310
Um Sakurai-sensei?

369
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,010
Yes!

370
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,510
I'm sorry I'm Sakurai from student counselling...

371
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,680
I'm sorry... Eh ah...

372
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:58,850
I get really nervous when there's so many people.

373
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,250
No good this is no good!

374
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,610
I can't always stand and look like a helpless teacher...

375
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,110
I have to say what I need to say properly!

376
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,910
I know!

377
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,910
Do you often see a goat on the school grounds lately?

378
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,660
Let's not take goats with us to the school grounds!

379
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,420
What's wrong...

380
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,500
What's wrong with goats?!

381
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,830
Going to school on a goat isn't prohibited by the school rules

382
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,430
am I right?!

383
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,640
Eh ah... that is...

384
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,450
Mio-chan isn't that Sasahara-senpai?

385
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,890
Eh really?

386
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,900
No... I'll permit goats!

387
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:51,350
It's rejected rejected!

388
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,410
Absolutely rejected!

389
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,380
There's no way it's okay to bring a goat to school!

390
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,410
You can say that but Tachibana Misato...

391
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,940
Why must I rush about on my own two legs?

392
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,590
First of all the heir of the Sasahara family...

393
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,010
What's that about the heir of the Sasahara family?

394
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,440
You guys are just normal farmers!

395
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,780
So?

396
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,180
What's wrong with the heir saying he's the heir?

397
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:18,850
Heh so Sasahara-kun's family are farmers.

398
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,690
I feel like I've been deceived.

399
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,000
So that goat at the bike rack was Sasahara-senpai's.

400
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,300
Riding a white goat Sasahara-senpai will come and pick me up!

401
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:43,220
A happy new year!

402
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,630
M-Me too!

403
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,050
Mio-chan!

404
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,050
Using a cellphone while riding a bicycle is very dangerous

405
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,680
let's stop doing that!

406
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,020
And also one last thing...

407
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:08,260
This morning a Maitreya statue was in my shoe locker!

408
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:11,360
I don't think these kind of pranks are good.

409
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,620
Excuse us passing through...

410
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,610
A Maitreya statue.

411
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,120
Mai-chan!

412
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,700
Don't stop suddenly!

413
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,480
Ah this thing again?

414
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,380
It might be déjà vu.

415
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,060
Who did it?!

416
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,540
I won't get mad so raise your hand!

417
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,240
You'll all stay here until he comes forth!

418
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,070
Who was it?

419
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,350
You go forth.

420
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:50,320
I'm sorry I heard it was Sakurai-sensei's birthday so...{start earlier}

421
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:56,660
I see a Maitreya statue is no good eh?

422
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:03,200
With good intentions on your birthday a present.

423
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,670
I'll imagine that you don't need a Maitreya statue.

424
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,170
The principal.

425
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,060
With this the morning assembly is finished.

426
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,140
Thank you very much for your work up until today Principal.

427
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,810
Deputy principal?!{check consistency}

428
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,550
This fire hydrant button has a really strong magical pull that makes you want to press it doesn't it?

429
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,690
Indeed.

430
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,410
What if you try pressing it?

431
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,110
The alarm didn't go off last time I pressed it.

432
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,640
Eh?

433
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,740
Really?

434
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,950
Fire?

435
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:43,800
No way!

436
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,730
What should we do?

437
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,330
Are we going to run?

438
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,450
Everyone!

439
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:47,670
For now let's go to the court!

440
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:52,060
What are you pushing me aside for?!

441
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,260
You're the one pushing me!

442
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,330
What're you saying?

443
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,440
Besides I've always hated you!

444
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,420
Stop it!

445
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,970
We might end up dying here!

446
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,280
Let's get out of here first!

447
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,350
Leave the arguing for later!

448
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,520
Um...

449
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,990
I'm sorry but what is "KY"?{add TL Note: "KY" is short for "Kuukiyomenai" in Japanese which mean "not considering the situation." iken: more literally unable to read the atmosphere.}

450
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,990
TL Note: "KY" is short for "Kuuki Yomenai" meaning "unable to read the atmosphere".

451
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,100
Um...

452
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,120
What could "KY" be?

453
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,970
I'm sorry please tell me about "KY"!

454
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:26,500
Help me someone!

455
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,660
Hey!

456
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,130
Oh Captain... What could "KY" be?

457
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,880
It's referring to you.

458
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,170
Second grade Class B Sasahara Koujirou.

459
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:43,380
Please come to the staff room immediately to Tomioka.

460
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:51,150
It's true it's not violating the school rules... But a goat?

461
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,960
Can't you do something about it?

462
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,050
If you don't like to walk

463
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,420
you could come by bicycle... Just as long as it's not a goat.

464
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,280
Sir.

465
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,510
It's Tomioka.

466
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,490
Tomioka.

467
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:02,780
Add sensei to it.

468
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,650
Sensei.

469
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:08,790
Can you call him Sasahara Kojirou and not goat?

470
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,420
He is a goat for now.

471
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,930
My name is Shinonome Nano.

472
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,930
I'm a robot created by Professor whom I live with.

473
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:32,860
Professor seems to be doing some kind of research

474
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,730
and is at home all day.

475
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,690
I spend my days while also helping out the professor.

476
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,820
Professor!

477
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,870
I warmed up the milk{\fscx300}-{\r}

478
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:51,790
I don't have any special features but it seems like I can still feel pain.

479
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,790
Nano what's wrong?

480
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,880
Professor!

481
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,970
My little toe...!

482
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:57,960
My little toe was...!

483
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:02,970
Y-Your l-little toe was...!

484
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,720
With this you should be fine for now.

485
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,250
Eh?!

486
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,480
I don't have any special features

487
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,230
but it seems like you can take off my little toe.

488
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,530
Professor what's this key for?

489
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:26,120
I didn't turn it?

490
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,910
Ah yes it turns sometimes.

491
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,750
You turn it like this.

492
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,130
Ah what's going on?!

493
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,650
I'm sorry I'm full of special features.

494
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,750
See it's something interesting isn't it?

495
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,360
Could it be that you made the key just for this?

496
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,030
Yup.

497
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,990
Could it be that you made the key just for this?!

498
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,080
Yup!

499
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,060
Take it off please!

500
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:56,810
No way!

501
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,610
Eh?!

502
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,980
Because it's cute.

503
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:01,570
Remove it from my back please!

504
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,400
Eh... But it's cute...

505
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,860
I want to be more normal. {iken: wrong TL here and next 2 lines. corrected}

506
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,720
I want to sit on a chair like a normal person

507
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,700
and turn over when I sleep.

508
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:17,290
With this I can't even go to school.

509
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:22,340
I would've been okay with not being a human-type robot at all.

510
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,410
Nano...

511
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,370
I-It's just a lie!

512
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,500
A lie!

513
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,000
Don't take it seriously Professor!

514
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,490
Then take it... {iken: corrected. Over here it sounds like hakase will remove the key. But two lines down it's a different meaning with the some starting words.}

515
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:36,020
Eh?

516
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,850
Go and win the Akutagawa Award for Literature!

517
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,150
Why?!

518
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,260
Win the Akutagawa Award!

519
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,650
Every day is like that.

520
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,410
Where am I?{missing line iken: it's right here}

521
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,040
Hello!

522
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,580
This is Nano-chan's big toe!

523
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,560
My capacity is one gigabyte.

524
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,650
I would've preferred to be a bit bigger...

525
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,430
The next episode of Nichijou is episode two.

526
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,040
Please look forward to it!
